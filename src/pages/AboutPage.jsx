            <p>
                I studied Mechanical Engineering and minored in Computer Science at The Cooper Union where 
                I graduated in May 2022. After graduating I worked for a LIDAR company in San Francisco, 
                where I got experience with hardware testing and programming collaboration. I joined this 
                boot camp because I wanted to improve my programming skills in a more consistent manner than 
                teaching myself, and I wanted to take advantage of the career resources. Outside of 
                programming I enjoy photography, aquariums, and bar trivia.
